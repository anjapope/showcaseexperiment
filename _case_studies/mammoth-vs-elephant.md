A carved figurine presented for analysis raised questions about whether it was crafted from endangered elephant ivory or legally tradeable mammoth ivory.

## The Challenge

Visual examination alone cannot reliably distinguish mammoth ivory from elephant ivory, particularly in finished objects where diagnostic features may be obscured. The owner needed definitive identification for legal and insurance purposes.

## Analytical Approach

We extracted DNA from a small sample taken from an inconspicuous area of the object. Despite the material's age, the cold preservation conditions of mammoth remains often allow remarkable DNA survival.

### Results

Successful amplification of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene yielded sequences that matched woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) references with high confidence. No elephant DNA was detected.

### Significance

This case illustrates the power of DNA analysis to provide definitive species identification. Mammoth ivory, originating from animals that died thousands of years ago, is not subject to the same trade restrictions as modern elephant ivory, making accurate identification crucial for collectors and dealers.
