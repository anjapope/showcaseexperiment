date: 2024-01-15
category: "Isotopic Analysis"
key_findings:
  - "Ivory originated from East African elephant populations"
  - "Carbon dating confirmed manufacture between 1870-1890"
  - "Stable isotope ratios consistent with savanna environment"
methodology: "Samples were analyzed using stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry (SIRMS) for carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen isotopes. Strontium isotope analysis was performed to narrow geographic origin."

This case study examines a set of piano keys from a late 19th century Steinway piano, investigating the geographic origin of the ivory used in their manufacture.

## Background

The piano, acquired by a private collector, came with limited provenance documentation. The owner sought to understand the origin of the ivory keys as part of a broader study of instrument manufacturing during the Victorian era.

## Analysis

We extracted small samples from damaged sections of three keys, ensuring minimal impact to the instrument's historical integrity. The samples underwent preparation for isotopic analysis at our partner laboratory.

### Carbon and Nitrogen Isotopes

The δ13C and δ15N values indicated a C4-dominated diet typical of African savanna elephants, distinguishing the ivory from forest elephant populations which typically show C3 plant signatures.

### Strontium Isotopes

The 87Sr/86Sr ratios were compared against our reference database of known geographic locations. The values were most consistent with elephant populations from the Tsavo region of Kenya, a major source of ivory during the 19th century ivory trade.

## Conclusions

This analysis demonstrates how scientific testing can provide geographic information about ivory when documentary evidence is lacking. The findings are consistent with historical records of British ivory imports during this period.
