Johannes Müller represents the fourth generation of his family to work as an ivory carver in Erbach, Germany, historically one of Europe's most important centers of ivory craftsmanship.

## Interview Excerpt

**Researcher:** Can you describe how you first learned to work with ivory?

**Johannes:** I started watching my grandfather when I was perhaps five or six years old. He wouldn't let me touch the tools at first—only observe. "First you must learn to see the material," he would say. I spent months just handling pieces of ivory, feeling the grain, understanding how it wanted to be shaped before I ever picked up a chisel.

**Researcher:** How does ivory compare to other materials you work with?

**Johannes:** There is nothing quite like it. The way it takes detail, the warmth it develops in your hands as you work. Bone is similar but more brittle. Modern synthetics can look the same but they feel dead. Ivory has a quality that is hard to describe—a life to it, even though it comes from something no longer living.

**Researcher:** How has the trade ban affected your work?

**Johannes:** It changed everything, of course. The young carvers now work primarily with alternatives—tagua nut, bone, antler. Some of us still work with antique ivory, pieces that were already worked before the bans. But the tradition, the deep knowledge of working with this material, it is fading with each generation.

## Reflections

This interview captures crucial knowledge about traditional ivory carving techniques that risks being lost as practitioners age and regulations limit new work with the material. Johannes's descriptions of material properties and working methods provide valuable context for understanding historical ivory objects in museum collections.
