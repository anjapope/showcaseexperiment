Margaret Chen inherited a collection of Japanese netsuke from her grandmother, who acquired many pieces during the 1920s and 1930s.

## Interview Excerpt

**Researcher:** How did your family come to collect netsuke?

**Margaret:** My grandmother lived in Yokohama in the 1920s—my grandfather was a shipping agent. She became fascinated with netsuke after attending an exhibition at a department store. Over the years, she acquired perhaps fifty pieces, mostly from dealers she came to know personally.

**Researcher:** What do these objects mean to you?

**Margaret:** They're connection points to my grandmother, whom I barely knew. Each piece has a story she recorded in a little notebook—where she bought it, what the dealer told her about it, sometimes what she was thinking or feeling that day. The ivory netsuke in particular have this warmth from years of handling. My grandmother would take them out and hold them while she talked to us.

**Researcher:** How do you feel about ivory now, given conservation concerns?

**Margaret:** It's complicated. These pieces are part of my family history, created long ago from animals that died long before I was born. But I understand why new ivory trade is banned. I've documented everything carefully so these pieces can be appreciated as historical objects, not as something to be replicated.

## Context

Margaret's account illustrates how ivory objects become embedded in family narratives and cultural identity. Her grandmother's documentation provides valuable provenance information that complements scientific analysis.
