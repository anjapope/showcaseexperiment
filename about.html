        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>We are a multidisciplinary research team dedicated to understanding ivory materials through comprehensive investigation. Our work combines cutting-edge scientific analysis with the rich context provided by oral histories and archival research.</p>
        
        <p>By integrating these approaches, we aim to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Determine the origin, age, and authenticity of ivory objects</li>
            <li>Preserve knowledge about ivory traditions and craftsmanship</li>
            <li>Support conservation efforts and legal enforcement</li>
            <li>Contribute to the broader understanding of cultural heritage</li>
        </ul>
